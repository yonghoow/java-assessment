What did you like about this project?
Ans: I like that I am able to use what we learned in class and apply them to the Java Assessment.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Ans: I had to struggle with understanding what the classes and methods are used for in the java assessment. 
After that, coming up with the codes for the methods also made me struggle for a considerable long time.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Ans: I realise what I know about Java at the moment is only quite basic and there is much to learn. I should have spend more time 
revising after class, which will make my experience with the assesssment better and not struggle all the way during the assessment.
